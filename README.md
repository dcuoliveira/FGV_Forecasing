# FGV_Forecasing
This repository will be used to organize all the codes written on the statistical modelling course given at the school of applied math at FGV-Rio on 2020 by prof. Claudio Struchiner. The main goal of the course is to teach students about generalized linear models (GLM) with a bayesian perspective.
